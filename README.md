# example-go-client
_____
The purpose of this repo is to show how to use interfaces as a means of implementing a standard "client" package in a multidue of ways. Allowing a logical (same binary) implementation, a HTTP REST implementation, and a mock (for testing) implementation.

This is a very basic quick creation and by all means is an example of method signatures being implemnted differently for different environments.
